## Usage Instructions

### Basic Batch Operations
1. **Select Multiple Prompts**: Use Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click to select multiple prompts
2. **Batch Operations Panel**: Appears automatically showing selected count and quick actions
3. **Quick Actions**: Use "Copy All", "Delete All", or "Batch Operations..." buttons
4. **Context Menu**: Right-click for additional batch operation options

### Advanced Batch Operations
1. **Open Batch Dialog**: Click "Batch Operations..." or press Ctrl+B
2. **Choose Operation**: Select from delete, tag management, move, export, etc.
3. **Configure Options**: Set parameters for the selected operation
4. **Execute**: Run the operation with progress tracking
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch progress bar and status updates

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+A`: Select all prompts in current view
- `Ctrl+I`: Invert current selection
- `Escape`: Clear all selections
- `Ctrl+B`: Open batch operations dialog
- `Ctrl+Shift+C`: Quick copy all selected prompts
- `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`: Quick delete all selected prompts

## Export Formats

### JSON Export
